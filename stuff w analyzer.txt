To-Do for NEXT update
- lobby adv
- lobby average rank
- pub/priv


Advantage Formula:
((AverageMarineRank - ZombieRank) / 7 + (AverageMarineRank + ZombieRank) - 31) / 31


Things to do
 - Add ARES tank mods
 - Add diverts
 - Add save files to user/documents feature
   - Maybe as onizanalyzer
 - Viro
 - How many upgraded structures are built (check UnitTypeChanges)


Much more down the line
- bank reclaimer
- discord bot
- player improvement suggestions
    - average unspent gas throughout the game?
- marginal analysis
    - make game ID (re-hash the compounded player signatures), and if it exists in the excel file, then don't analyze
    - would also have to add to previous file
- leaver lobby analysis



Needs Fixes
- creep tower count is weird?

Data to be Added
- lobby average rank
- pub/private check
- lobby advantage



226 - 5.6 ~ 6.5 sec
16 - 2.1 seconds
142 - 4.1 seconds
120~ takes roughly 2 seconds, so maybe 60 per second? Initial time of 2 seconds?


Bank data analysis
- Goal: outline the most recent bank data
- How to: match username and handle to find latest data
- Requisites:
    1. If bank reset has been detected, then keep last data and add on any future data to it
        possibly detect final data and add in any 'resets' that have happened? (1) - reset - (2) -> (1) + (2)
        What if bank has been recovered? If significant gap is detected, then add the data right before this to it?
    2. handle should be the main go-to for player identification (how to obtain this though?)
    3. data structure should be totaldict: {handle - playerdict}, playerdict: {key - values} (kv in playerdict should be the data from bank)
- Procedure:
    1. mine data from replay
    2. match mined data with previous data
        1) if previous data exists, then add onto previous data
        2) if new data, then create data
