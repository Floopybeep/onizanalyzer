Algorithm Plan

1. determine the winner/loser of game
2. Loop over the events
    2.1. Add/modify H/Z player data using relevant event (complete one at a time)
        2.1.1.
    2.2.


To-Do
1. order humanupgradecomplete.py -      humanUCEcheck by descending order of frequency of use
2. optimize humanupgradecomplete.py -   would implementing a set of all names used help in optimization?
                                        maybe check if command is in the set before start checking the if statements?
                                        better yet, make a blacklist of things NOT to check for!
3. implement multiprocess
4. implement UI

5. zombie hangarcaptures -              Also check for dropship unitchange event
6. update playerclasses.py -            experimental dict, ultimate infestation set

7. add to mainprocess.py -              Check for leavers! if there are 2 or more zergs, then there is a leaver!
                                        Implement a player_check process, which picks up this anomaly
                                        Could also edit the extract_playerinfo at infoextract.py

99. Suggest Improvements                - measure time between DropshipsFueled and UltimateInfestationResearched (UpgradeCompleteEvent)
