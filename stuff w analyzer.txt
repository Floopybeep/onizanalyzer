To-Do for NEXT update
- game length
- lobby adv
- lobby average rank
- pub/priv




Things to do
 - Update PROGRESSBAR & TEXT BOX
   - One suggestion is to have one thread to run GUI, and another to receive updates from a queue
     - Maybe have one queue for feeding into the mp.pool, and another to receive completed tasks? (for pbar)
 - Add ARES tank mods
 - Group processes into ONE PROCESS?
   - task manager shows 30 different processes lol
 - Add diverts
 - Add save files to user/documents feature
   - Maybe as onizanalyzer
 - Viro
 - How many upgraded structures are built (check unittypechanges)


Much more down the line
- bank reclaimer
- discord bot
- player improvement suggestions
    - average unspent gas throughout the game?
- marginal analysis
    - make game ID (re-hash the compounded player signatures), and if it exists in the excel file, then don't analyze
    - would also have to add to previous file



Needs Fixes
- creep tower count is weird?

Data to be Added
- lobby average rank
- pub/private check
- lobby advantage
