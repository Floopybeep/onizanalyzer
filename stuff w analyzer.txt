To-Do for NEXT update
- lobby adv
- lobby average rank
- pub/priv


Advantage Formula:
((AverageMarineRank - ZombieRank) / 7 + (AverageMarineRank + ZombieRank) - 31) / 31


Things to do
 - Add ARES tank mods
 - Add diverts
 - Add save files to user/documents feature
   - Maybe as onizanalyzer
 - Viro
 - How many upgraded structures are built (check UnitTypeChanges)


Much more down the line
- bank reclaimer
- discord bot
- player improvement suggestions
    - average unspent gas throughout the game?
- marginal analysis
    - make game ID (re-hash the compounded player signatures), and if it exists in the excel file, then don't analyze
    - would also have to add to previous file
- leaver lobby analysis



Needs Fixes
- creep tower count is weird?

Data to be Added

226 - 5.6 ~ 6.5 sec
16 - 2.1 seconds
