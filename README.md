# onizanalyzer

Things to do
 - Add ARES tank mods
 - Add diverts
 - Add excel table of data
   - More complicated than I thought - how am I going to keep updating the dataframe?
 - Add save files to user/documents feature 
   - Maybe as onizanalyzer
 - Add duplicate checker
   - prototype is already made from arguing w frosky - I can reuse much of that
   - use bank signatures to match?


Much more down the line
- bank reclaimer
- .exe file size reduction (optimization)
  - Done by creating a fresh env and installing only the necessary packages
- discord bot
