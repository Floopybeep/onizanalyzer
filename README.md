# onizanalyzer

Things to do
 - Update PROGRESSBAR & TEXT BOX
   - One suggestion is to have one thread to run GUI, and another to receive updates from a queue
     - Maybe have one queue for feeding into the mp.pool, and another to receive completed tasks? (for pbar)
 - Add ARES tank mods
 - Group processes into ONE PROCESS?
   - task manager shows 30 different processes lol
